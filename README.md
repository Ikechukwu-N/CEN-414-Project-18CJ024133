Project Title: Percentage of births delivered by caesearean section

Introduction:
Vaginal birth is a natural and physiological process.
However, in certain circumstances, a caesarean section (CS) may be required to protect the woman and the babyâ€™s health.
In those circumstances, underuse of CS contributes to increased maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.
Conversely, overuse (ie, the use of CS with no medical indication) has not shown benefits and may create harm and waste of human and financial resources.
Thus, optimising the use of CS is of global concern and a challenge in public health.

This project analyses the data from 2005-2014 for every nation in Africa utilizing bar charts to indicate the increasing and decreasing rates.
It also represents various measures of disperion(mean, standard deviation, variance, median) thus giving an insight to the percentage of c-section over 10 years
